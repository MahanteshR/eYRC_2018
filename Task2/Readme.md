# Problem Statement:
You are given an image similar to the arena image. It has the same geometric structure like theme
arena as seen in its top view. The problem you solve here is to find non-empty (Animal and Habitat
locations) squares from the given arena image and also mark their location according to arena
location convention.
Along with that you should also be able to copy whatever there is in this non-empty Animal or
Habitat locations as separate image files.
